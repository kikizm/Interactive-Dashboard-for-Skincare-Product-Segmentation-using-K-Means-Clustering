The skincare industry is experiencing rapid growth with thousands of new products entering the market every year. Increasing competition requires companies to understand product characteristics and consumer behavior more deeply. Unfortunately, the abundance of skincare product data is often presented in static tables, making it difficult to analyze quickly and efficiently. This situation risks causing companies to miss opportunities in identifying the most popular products, recognizing market segments based on price, ratings, and reviews, and optimizing promotional strategies as well as inventory management. To address these challenges, a solution is needed that can transform raw data into actionable insights that are easy to understand and directly applicable to business strategies. Through the development of an **Interactive Dashboard for Skincare Product Segmentation**, companies can leverage the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group products into distinct segments such as mass market, mid-tier, and premium. This interactive dashboard allows management to analyze data in real-time, extract relevant insights, and make faster, more accurate, and data-driven decisions in navigating the dynamic skincare market.
