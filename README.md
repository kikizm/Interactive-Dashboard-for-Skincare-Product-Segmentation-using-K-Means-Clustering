## üìÅ STAGE 0 : Problem Statement

### Introduction

The skincare industry is experiencing rapid growth with thousands of new products entering the market every year. Increasing competition requires companies to understand product characteristics and consumer behavior more deeply. Unfortunately, the abundance of skincare product data is often presented in static tables, making it difficult to analyze quickly and efficiently. This situation risks causing companies to miss opportunities in identifying the most popular products, recognizing market segments based on price, ratings, and reviews, and optimizing promotional strategies as well as inventory management. To address these challenges, a solution is needed that can transform raw data into actionable insights that are easy to understand and directly applicable to business strategies. Through the development of an **Interactive Dashboard for Skincare Product Segmentation**, companies can leverage the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group products into distinct segments such as mass market, mid-tier, and premium. This interactive dashboard allows management to analyze data in real-time, extract relevant insights, and make faster, more accurate, and data-driven decisions in navigating the dynamic skincare market.


### Goal 
The main goal of this project is to provide a **practical decision-support tool** in the form of an interactive dashboard that presents skincare product segmentation results using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. This tool is designed to help businesses move beyond static spreadsheets by offering **interactive visualizations** that can be easily explored by management to gain deeper market understanding.

### Objectives
To achieve the stated goal, this project is structured into several key objectives:

1. Perform **data preprocessing** on skincare product datasets, including cleaning, transformation, and normalization.

2. Apply **K-Means Clustering** to group products based on attributes such as price, ratings, and reviews.

3. Develop an **interactive dashboard using Streamlit** to visualize clustering results and support real-time data exploration.

4. Provide **business insights** on product distribution and consumer preferences to support marketing strategies and inventory management.

## üìÇ STAGE 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Overview
The dataset consists of 7,637 rows and 19 attributes, but only three main numerical features (price_by_combination, average_rating, total_reviews) were selected for clustering. <br>

Table 1 ‚Äì Feature Description

| Feature                | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `product_name`         | Name of the skincare product                       |
| `brand_name`           | Brand of the product                               |
| `categories`           | Product category (e.g., toner, serum, moisturizer) |
| `price_by_combination` | Price of product in local currency                 |
| `average_rating`       | Average customer rating (scale 1‚Äì5)                |
| `total_reviews`        | Total number of product reviews                    |

| Missing values      | Some missing values found in `price_by_combination` and `average_rating` | Imputed using **median** for numeric, **mode** for categorical |
| Duplicates          | No duplicate records detected                                             | No action required                                              |
| Irrelevant features | Columns such as `url`, and `description`                                 | Removed from dataset                                            |
| Inconsistent values | Minor formatting inconsistencies in categories                           | Standardized and normalized                                     |
| Outliers            | Extreme values found in product prices                                   | Retained (considered as part of market diversity)              |
